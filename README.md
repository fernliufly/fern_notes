Do not do things that you do not like, even if it means by doing it you will get a ton of gold or the highest honor/prestige in the  human civilization among all nations and all races. 
And do things that you really like to the extent that you enjoy it (of course, not hurting anybody), even if it means in doing it, one will starve to death and no one knows who you are. 
We are born to die forever, not to live forever. 
After one dies, everything dies with it. What remains means nothing to you, because you no longer exist. Then how about those who are still living ? Well, they will find and walk their own ways.  
One can not and should not choose the ways for them. 
Reason: you do not know what the future and their futures will be. Why? because you are dead and disappeared and you no longer live a life.  

切换到git用户，并进入git用户的主目录，创建一个 .ssh目录
mkdir  .ssh  
cd .ssh 
ssh-keygen -t rsa   //以rsa的加密方式生成秘钥对  
在.ssh目录里创建一个authorized_keys文件，用于存放用户的公钥
touch authorized_keys
