just keep going
today is 20160802, i stay at home for the whole days, because of typhoon we are free, no work, just have a rest.
However i still keep learning, i am not smart girl, so i have to keep learning, one step by step, i want to go away far far away.
Now it's raining, rootmates are sleeping. i am a little bit sleepy.
where to go? try everythere, try everything
